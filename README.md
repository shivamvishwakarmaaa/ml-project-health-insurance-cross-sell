Health Insurance Cross-Sell Products Classification
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether an existing health insurance customer will be interested in a vehicle insurance product. The model leverages customer data to classify the likelihood of cross-selling success, thereby enabling targeted marketing strategies.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains customer information, including demographic details, policy details, and previous interactions. Key features include:

id: Unique identifier for each customer
Gender: Gender of the customer
Age: Age of the customer
Driving_License: Whether the customer holds a driving license
Region_Code: Code for the region of the customer
Previously_Insured: Whether the customer already has vehicle insurance
Vehicle_Age: Age of the vehicle
Vehicle_Damage: Whether the customerâ€™s vehicle was damaged in the past
Annual_Premium: The amount of annual premium (in dollars)
Policy_Sales_Channel: Code for the channel through which the policy was sold
Vintage: Number of days since the customer joined the company
Response: Whether the customer is interested in the vehicle insurance product (target variable)

Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/shivamvishwakarmaaa/ml-project-health-insurance-cross-sell.git
cd health-insurance-cross-sell
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preprocessing
Explore the data:
Navigate to the notebooks/ directory and open data_exploration.ipynb to understand the dataset and visualize key features.

Run preprocessing scripts:

bash
Copy code
python src/preprocess.py
This script handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.

Model Training
Train the model:

bash
Copy code
python src/train_model.py
This script splits the data into training and validation sets, trains the model, and saves the best model.

Evaluate the model:

bash
Copy code
python src/evaluate_model.py
This script loads the trained model and evaluates its performance on the validation set, generating relevant metrics and plots.

Prediction
To predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing vehicle insurance, use the saved model:

bash
Copy code
python src/predict.py --input_file path_to_input_file --output_file path_to_output_file
